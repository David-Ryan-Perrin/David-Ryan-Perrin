Hello, my name is Dave Perrin. I am a data scientist currently working at a consulting firm. I have experience providing statistical and machine learning solutions in the fields of computational ecology, finance and human resources. While I have several repos, I can only share a few due to confidentiality reasons. If you are interested in my qualifications (or are just curious), please see the repo below:

- FishNET: A neural network which predicts the probability that a given species will be within 2 kilometers of random GPS coordinate in river systems. 2 kilometers is used as that is a common distance that various fishes will travel within a day. This was a collaboration with researchers at a lab at the University of Texas at Austin.
