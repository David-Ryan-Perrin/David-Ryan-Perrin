Hello, my name is Dave Perrin. I am a data scientist and I currently work in the field of people analytics (data science for human resources). I've previously worked in computational ecology and finance. While I have several repos, I can only share a few due to confidentiality reasons. If you are interested in my qualifications (or are just curious), please see the repos below:

- FishNET: A neural network which predicts the probability that a given species will be within 2 kilometers of random GPS coordinate in river systems. 2 kilometers is used as that is a common distance that various fishes will travel within a day. This was a collaboration with researchers at a lab at the University of Texas at Austin.

- Employee Attrition Ensemble (WORK IN PROGRESS, WILL BE OPENED UP SHORTLY): A stacked ensemble model which utilizes several survival analysis methods to predict employee attrition. After training, each employee is assigned an attrition risk score. The higher an employees risk score, the more likely they are to exit the company voluntarily. This is very similar to a model I created in my current role. Data used: IBM Attrition dataset.

- In progress: Recommendation System. Utilizes data from Instacart to recommend items to users.
